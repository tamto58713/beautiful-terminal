# Beautiful Terminal for Git
I want to share you beautiful terminal and showing current branch for git.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tamto58713/beautiful-terminal.git
```

## Update
```bash
git pull
```

## Usage
Moving file '.bashrc' to '/home'. 
After you were moving it in '/home', let's open terminal and use command 'source ~/.bashrc'. 

(if you can't see file '.bashrc'. you can press 'Ctrl + H' to see it)

## Thank you!!!!
