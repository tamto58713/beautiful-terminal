#Beautiful Terminal for Git
I want to share you beautiful terminal and showing current branch for git.

##Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tamto58713/beautiful-terminal.git
```

##Update
```bash
git pull
```

##Usage
Moving file '.bashrc' to '/home'. After you were moving it in '/home', let's open terminal and use command 'source ~/.bashrc'. 
(if you can't see file '.bashrc'. you can press 'Ctrl + H' to see it)
##Thank you!!!!
